This is a first project made during my second year of highschool,

It is a game meant to be similiar to this: https://www.higherorlowergame.com/

During the creation of this information about programming was very limited, The game is made with no real knowledge of either HTML or CSS and is therefor very limited and poorly done.

However it shows that we all start from somewhere and that the way forward is bright even if it looks bad from the start
